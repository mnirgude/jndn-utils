This project is a collection of tools to simplify synchronous and asynchronous data transfer over the NDN network. It relies on the [NDN Protocol](https://named-data.net) and its associated [client library](https://github.com/named-data/jndn).

## Install
With Maven, add the following to your POM:
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.intel.jndn.utils</groupId>
  <artifactId>jndn-utils</artifactId>
  <version>RELEASE</version> <!-- or a specific version -->
</dependency>
```

## Build

To build, run `mvn install` in the cloned directory. Additionally, you may want
to run integration tests by running the `nfd-integration-tests` profile with 
a running NFD instance (see [pom.xml](https://github.com/01org/jndn-utils/blob/master/pom.xml) for more details);

## Use

This library provides `Client`, `Server` and `Repository` interfaces. These
are implemented in their respective `impl` packages and require Java 8. 

Use a `SimpleClient` or `AdvancedClient` (provides segmentation, retries, and streaming)
 to retrieve data from the network. For example:
```
// retrieve a single Data packet synchronously, will block until complete
Data singleData = SimpleClient.getDefault().getSync(face, name);

// retrieve segmented Data packets (i.e. with a last Component containing a segment number and a valid FinalBlockId) by name
CompletableFuture<Data> segmentedData = AdvancedClient.getDefault().getAsync(face, name);
```

Use `SimpleServer` or `SegmentedServer` to serve data on the network. For example:
```
// segment and serve Data packet under a specific prefix
RepositoryServer server = new SegmentedServer(face, prefix);
server.serve(largeDataPacket); // call face.processEvents() in an event loop

// add signatures; this pipeline stage will sign each Data packet prior to being encoded for transport
server.addPipelineStage(new SigningStage(keyChain, signingCertificateName));
```

For the full API, see the [Javadoc](http://01org.github.io/jndn-utils/).

## Logging

`jndn-utils` uses Java's default logging utilities (see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/package-summary.html). Most messages are logged with the FINER or FINEST status; one way to change this is to add a `logging.properties` file in the classpath with the following lines:
```
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
.level=FINEST
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINEST
```
